# Pulsar Detection using Machine Learning

A pulsar is a highly magnetized rotating compact star (usually neutron stars but also white dwarfs) that emits beams of electromagnetic radiation out of its magnetic poles. This radiation can be observed only when a beam of emission is pointing toward Earth. (Source: *Wikipedia*)

Due to interference from radio waves generated by electronic equipment on Earth, it is very difficult to distinguish a real Pulsar Star from noise. 

Telescopes provides astronomers with huge amount of data regarding Pulsars. It is usually difficult for astronomers to look for patterns in data and use their brains to find a promising candidate. So I have tried to implement Machine Learning models to aid them in finding Pulsars. 

The web app is deployed on Heroku. Play around with it. [Pulsar detection App on Heroku](https://pulsar-detection.herokuapp.com/) ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†
