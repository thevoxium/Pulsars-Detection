# Pulsar Detection using Machine Learning

I will apply Machine Learning models to detect Pulsar Stars. I will add information as I proceed.

### Literature Review
The list of papers I have studied for the project:

* [Detection of Pulsars Using an Artificial Neural Network](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-981-13-7403-6_15)
* [Detecting Pulsar Stars in Space using Artificial Neural Networks](https://medium.com/swlh/detecting-pulsar-stars-in-space-using-artificial-neural-networks-d60428141d09)
* [Machine Learning for Pulsar Detection](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/BDB20B965BEDE39A6CF6C016F87E6BD7/S1743921317009000a.pdf/machine_learning_for_pulsar_detection.pdf)
